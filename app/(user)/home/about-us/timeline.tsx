    moreInfo: 'Back in 1995, a group of passionate divers came together with a shared dream of introducing more people to the underwater treasures of Batangas. What started as a small dive shop with limited resources gradually grew into a trusted name in the diving community. From the very beginning, our mission was to promote both world-class diving experiences and sustainable tourism practices that would protect the reefs for generations to come.'

    moreInfo: 'With the increasing pressures on marine ecosystems, we recognized our responsibility to act as stewards of the ocean. In 2010, we partnered with local communities, marine biologists, and NGOs to establish coral nurseries, conduct reef cleanups, and provide eco-diving courses. Our eco-initiative not only raised awareness among divers but also contributed directly to the rehabilitation of degraded reefs, ensuring that the beauty of Anilaoâ€™s marine life would be preserved for future generations.'

In 2020, we introduced virtual classrooms, interactive workshops, and live sessions with instructors, allowing aspiring divers to continue learning even while at home. This program not only kept the diving spirit alive during challenging times but also expanded our reach to international students who might not have had the chance to travel to Anilao before.'
